# Chapter 7 - Arrays
# I'm a client working for the Blank House.
# We want to display positive tweets about our president on our website.
# However, our president is kind of unpopular, and we pretty much only receive negative press.
# Write me a program that filters out the following words from tweets:
# "sucks", "bad", "hate", "foolish", and the most popular: "danger to society".
# Replace each negative word or phrase them with the word "CENSORED".
# Some test tweets have been provided for you.
